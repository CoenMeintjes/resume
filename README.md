## Data Professional | Freelance Analyst | Data Science Enthusiast

---

I have a strong background in data analytics, a passion for problem-solving, and a proven track record of delivering impactful insights, I believe that I can contribute to your data team's success.

### Education and Skills

I have completed a comprehensive variety of courses through Coursera, acquiring the skills of a data professional. My coursework includes the Google Advanced Data Analytics program, where I gained expertise in data science foundations, Python for data analysis, exploratory data analysis, statistical analysis, regression analysis, and machine learning. Additionally, I have developed proficiency in Python, Pandas, Numpy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, SQL, and Git. I am also skilled in data visualization using tools such as Tableau, Power BI, Excel, and Looker.

### Experience and Accomplishments

In my role as a freelance analyst at Investor Relations Exchange, I enhanced data analysis processes by establishing connections to API data feeds in Power BI, enabling seamless data loading, transformation, and access to diverse datasets. I created interactive dashboards, implemented DAX formulas, and collaborated with the client to develop financial data visualizations that empowered investors in making data-driven decisions. I also implemented automated data update processes to ensure up-to-date information availability for analysis.

As a freelance data analyst at Pure Structure Trading, I analyzed website, YouTube, and newsletter metrics using Looker and Excel to provide actionable insights and recommendations. I developed and maintained the company's website on WordPress, integrated workflow automation tools, and produced finance and trading-related content leveraging technical market analysis.

In my current role as an independent fund manager, I have developed and implemented analysis-driven trading strategies in the US Equity and WTI Crude Oil Futures markets. My best-performing strategy achieved a 43% win rate with a 1.8:1 risk-reward ratio over 163 live market trades. I have also leveraged comprehensive data analysis and implemented Python-based quantitative systems for algorithmic trading, enhancing efficiency and reducing the risk of human error in trade execution.
